            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Flashover ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our web application (the "Service").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information that is necessary for the application to function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and password. This information is used for authentication and to identify you within the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Data:</strong> All data you create within the application, including but not limited to appliance names, locker layouts, item details, and check reports, is stored in your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Brigade Information:</strong> If you create or join a brigade, your membership and role within that brigade are stored. Data you create for a brigade (like appliance layouts) will be accessible to other members of that brigade.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used solely to provide and improve the Service. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authenticating your access to the application.</li>
                <li>Storing and retrieving your inventory data so you can perform checks.</li>
                <li>Allowing you to create, join, and manage brigades.</li>
                <li>Saving and displaying past reports for your records.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>All of your data is stored securely on Google Firebase, a platform that provides industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

            <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties for their commercial purposes. Information is only shared within the application as required for its functionality (e.g., brigade data is shared with other brigade members).</p>

            <h2>5. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
            <p>You have full control over the data you create. You can add, edit, and delete your appliances, items, and reports at any time through the application's interface.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].</p>
