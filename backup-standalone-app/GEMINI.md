# Project: Flashover

## Description

Flashover is a single-file web application for managing and checking the inventory of a fire truck appliance. It is designed to run in a web browser on mobile devices like tablets.

The app has two primary modes:
1.  **Setup Mode:** Allows users to define the truck's layout, including lockers, shelves, and individual items with names, descriptions, and photos.
2.  **Check Mode:** A guided workflow for checking items, marking them as present, missing, or adding notes, and viewing a final summary report of any issues.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML:** The core structure of the application.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles all the application logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling, included via a CDN.

## Development Guidelines

*   **Backups:** When requested to create a backup, place the file in the `/backups` directory. Use a versioned naming scheme, for example: `Flashover Alpha 0.0.1.html`.
*   **Testing:** There is currently no formal testing framework established for this project.

## Agent Communication

*   **Be Direct:** Do not apologize or use unnecessary conversational fluff. Get straight to the point.
*   **Explain for a Beginner:** The user is a beginner coder. Explain technical concepts and the reasoning behind code simply and clearly.
