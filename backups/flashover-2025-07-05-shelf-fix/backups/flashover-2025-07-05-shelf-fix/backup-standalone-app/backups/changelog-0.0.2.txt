# Changelog - Flashover Alpha 0.0.2

## Changes from Version 0.0.1

*   **Re-implemented Container Functionality (Setup Mode Only):** The ability to define an item as a "container" has been added back into the "Setup Truck" section of the application.

## What's Working

*   **Full Setup Mode:** Users can create and manage lockers, shelves, and items.
*   **Container Creation:** Items can be designated as "Containers" via a dropdown in the item editor.
*   **Container Content Management:** A new, dedicated screen allows users to add, edit, and delete sub-items within a container.
*   **Check Mode (Unchanged):** The check mode remains functional but does not yet account for containers. It treats them as single items.

## What's Not Working / Next Steps

*   The "Check Mode" does not yet have the logic to "enter" a container and check its sub-items individually. This is the next major feature to be implemented.
